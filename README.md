1. The Project Overview
>The expense-tracking software I'm planning to build is called Budget Boss. It can help with savings by assisting users in tracking their spending, setting savings goals, monitoring their progress, and identifying areas where they can cut expenses. I'm using two tutorials to combine codes, maximize the output, and utilize everything we learned during the semester.
2. Benefit
>The great benefit is that it is easy to use; there are no more overwhelming spreadsheets or manual calculations; we only need to log our spending. One of the best things about a Budget Boss is that it automatically categorizes expenses and provides real-time updates on your spending habits. This feature alone can help you identify areas where you may be overspending and adjust accordingly.Budgeting apps can provide insights into spending patterns and offer personalized recommendations to help users save more money.
